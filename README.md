# Forest-Fires
 In this project, I predict forest fires in Algeria using meteorological and environmental data. I apply Ridge and Lasso regression for model training and feature selection. The Flask web application enables users to input data and receive predictions, designed with HTML and CSS. I deploy it on AWS for scalability and early detection support.
